## Project Presentation

Version History: 

- Clarification 2020/4/18 - Video hosting
- Released 2020/3/30

Team presentation videos should be linked in a Piazza thread by 9:30 AM on
Tuesday April 21st.

Individual evaluations are due via Github Classroom by Tuesday April 21st at
11:59 PM.

**Individual responses to presentations are due via Google Forms on Tuesday,
April 28th at 11:59 PM.**

For the Project Presentation we are:

- Sharing the project with classmates
- Explaining an overview of our design and rationale
- Discussing what was learned in observations
- Providing feedback to each other
- Practicing public presentations 
- Individually stating your contributions and the contributions of your team
  members to this presentation.

Use the following link to create your individual github repository for this
assignment:
[https://classroom.github.com/a/GR2yvwwd](https://classroom.github.com/a/GR2yvwwd).
At the time of submission, it should contain a text file named
`PP-evaluations.txt.` The file should have the content described under
Individual Evaluations below. This is the same format used in Project
milestones.

Individual feedback for other groups should be input at the following Google
Form: [https://forms.gle/twHfAeizFU3Xj3zD6](https://forms.gle/twHfAeizFU3Xj3zD6).

### Group: Presentation & Demo thread

Create a thread on Piazza titled: `[Group Name] Presentation and Demo`.

In that thread, include a link to a presentation video (content described
below) and a link to your github demo site. **You can host the video where you
choose (e.g., Google Drive, YouTube, DropBox). If you host it with
restrictions, please set to accept email.arizona.edu and cs.arizona.edu
accoutns.**

The presentation should cover:

- An overview of your system. Remember your classmates are probably unfamiliar
  with it. 
- Discussion of the design choices you made and their rationale. 
- Discussion of what you learned from your observations and what changes were
  made due to them. This may include things learned about observations rather
than about the interface itself and changes you made or would make in
conducting further evaluations.
- Similarly, some discussion of the architecture of the prototype and what you
  learned from implementing it.
- (Optional) Other issues you wish you knew when you started

The goals of the presentation are:

- The rest of the class understands your design enough to offer you
  constructive criticism
- The rest of the class benefits from the knowledge you gained (about design,
  observations, implementation, or anything else) by doing this project

The presentation should be 13-17 minutes in length. 

The presentation will be graded on:

- (30 pts) The inclusion of content as described above and the effectiveness and
  clarity of conveying that information
- (10 pts) Use of both visual aids and spoken word. You may include the demo
  in the video if you want.
- (15 pts) Overall structure and flow of the presentation -- Do topics and speakers
  change naturally or is it disjointed? Do people know what they are going to
say or do they halt and/or read off the slides?
- (10 pts) The Piazza thread itself with the demo and ease of video access,
  answers to questions from others, etc.

Suggestion: A talk of this length doesn't require an outline slide. If it
naturally works in as part of a larger point and/or conveys other information,
it can be helpful. If it is a slide with six bulleted words, it is usually not
worth the time and detracts from the overall presentation.


### Individual: Feedback (25 pts)

After the presentations, you will be asked for **constructive** criticism
(what you think is good about the design, what you think could be improved in
the design, what you thought was the most interesting, contentious, or
insightful part of the presentation). You may also try the team's demo to help
with your feedback, but the last question you should answer with respect to
the presentation. Your feedback in these forms will be **confidential** but
will be shared with the teams without your name attached.

If you would like to leave more public feedback or you have questions about
something in the presentation, you can respond on the Piazza thread.

**Remember**: Everyone has worked hard, many groups have had team members who
could no longer participate, and not everyone comes into this class with the
same background. Be kind.

 
### Individual: Individual Evaluations (5 pts) 

This content should be written by each individual after the presentation is
posted to Piazza. Please name it `pp-evaluation.txt.`

At the top of your evaluation, estimate the distribution of work contributed
by yourself and your teammates. You will do this by starting with 20 units for
each members of your team (a total of 60 for a 3 person team, 80 for a 4
person team). You will then apportion the units to yourself and your team
members to indicate distribution. If everyone has 20 unit, that means equal
distribution.

I will assess the distributions listed as well as the contributions described
for balance and may apply a weighting/scaling factor to individual grades to
account for discrepancies. More work does not necessarily mean a higher
grade--taking over the project and influencing others to not participate is
discouraged.


Example:
```
Unit Distribution

Blinky: 17

Pinky: 21

Inky: 22

Clyde: 20

```

The second paragraph should describe what your contributions to the project
milestone were:

```
Individual Contributions -- FamilyName, GivenName

My contributions were...
```

Then, for each of your team members, write a section headed with their name
explaining what their contributions were and rating them on:

1. Quality of Work
2. Timeliness of Work Completion
3. Contributions to Group Discussion
4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude

Ratings should be one of [Below Expectations, Good, Above and Beyond]. 

Beneath the ratings you may provide more detail explaining your ratings or any
other information I should know.


Example:
```
Peer Assessment -- FamilyName, GivenName

GivenName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Good

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Good

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

GivenName did a good job on the paper prototype but was two days later than we
planned so we had to scramble to make the movie.
```

### Distribution (5 pts)

All team members should speak during the presentation if able, help develop the
outline, as well as the transititions between speakers. Work could potentially
be divided by having each team member be in charge of designing their own
slides, but at least one team member would need to check for the cohesiveness
of the presentation.

**If a team member is unable to speak in the presentnation video due to
technology barriers and COVID-19 concerns, please state this in the individual
evaluations.**
